Here's my [programmatically generated](https://github.com/ccjmne/resume#readme) [resume](https://ccjmne.github.io/resume).  

And my [dotfiles](https://github.com/ccjmne/dotfiles2025),  
and my [Neovim config](https://github.com/ccjmne/nvim),  
and my [private GPG keys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ).

There's some nifty stuff buried in there, despite my general stance favouring the sane defaults, possibly choosing to further sanitise them *upstream* rather than sprinkling my flavour on top or aside.  
But mostly, it's pretty hygienic, fairly future-forward while not necessarily chasing the latest trend, and generally having passed the scrutinous ocular pat-down of a control-obsessed, ravenous, technical mind.
