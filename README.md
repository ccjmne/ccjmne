Here's my [programmatically generated resume](https://ccjmne.github.io/resume).  

And my [dotfiles](https://github.com/ccjmne/dotfiles2025),  
and my [Neovim config](https://github.com/ccjmne/nvim).

There's some nifty stuff buried in there, despite my general stance being to favour the sane defaults, possibly choosing to further sanitise the defaults *upstream* rather than sprinkling my flavour on top or aside.  
But mostly, it's pretty hygienic, fairly future-forward while not necessarily chasing the latest trend, and generally having passed the scrutinous ocular pat-down of a control-obsessed, ravenous, technical mind.
